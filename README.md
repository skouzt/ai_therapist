## üìÇ Code Structure & Conventions

The project follows a feature-oriented structure to keep the codebase organized and maintainable.

- **`app/`**: Contains all the routes and pages, following the Next.js App Router conventions.
- **`component/`**: Houses higher-level, feature-specific components (e.g., `component/homepage`, `component/Mira`).
- **`components/ui/`**: Includes reusable, low-level UI components from `shadcn/ui` (e.g., Button, Card, Input).
- **`lib/`**: Handles business logic, server-side actions (`lib/action`), and client/SDK initializations (Supabase, Vapi).
- **`constants/`**: Stores static data, such as configuration arrays and JSON files.

## üé® Styling & Theming

The project uses **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling. The theming system is built with CSS variables, allowing for easy customization and dynamic switching between light and dark modes.

- **`globals.css`**: Defines the base styles and CSS variables for colors, borders, and other theme-related properties.
- **`tailwind.config.js`**: Configures Tailwind CSS, extending the default theme with custom colors and properties that are mapped to the CSS variables. This setup, combined with `shadcn/ui`, provides a robust and flexible styling foundation.
